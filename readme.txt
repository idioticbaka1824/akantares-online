~~Goal:
You need to shoot down your opponent. You can control the direction/angle of your shot. Various obstacles situated in space will affect the trajectory of your shot via gravitational attraction. If you successfully hit your opponent, you get a point. The first person to get 5 points wins.

~~Controls:
Up/Down arrow keys on title screen to change game mode, space to confirm.
Left/Right arrow keys (or drag 'Direction' slider) to change angle. Hold shift when using arrow keys for slower/finer control.
Space (or click 'Go!') to fire.
Z to toggle 2x zoom.
Esc to pause (doesn't work in online multiplayer).

On touchscreens:
Esc = top-left corner
Z = bottom-left corner
Up arrow = top right corner
Down arrow = bottom right corner


~~~~Game modes:

~~Single player:
You are the blue planet. You play against the computer (which for now just picks a random angle so it's pretty easy...).

~~Offline multiplayer:
You take turns playing against an opponent. Both you and your opponent use the same controls. Blue aims and presses fire, then red aims and presses fire, after that the shot is actually 'carried out'.

~~Online multiplayer:
Initially a Lobby is displayed with a list of players hosting games. On mobile devices you may have to press a little downward arrow on the right side of the white field to see the list.
You can host a game by pressing the 'Host' button, and your name and the time is added to the list.
You can join someone's game by selecting their name/time from the list and clicking the 'Join' button. Once a hosted game is joined, it is removed from the lobby and the players (host and guest) are transferred to the actual gameplay screen to start playing it.
The shot is carried out once both players have made their move (and they may do so in any order).
There is also a chat function. You can also choose a funny face for your player from the drop-down list.


~~Issues:
Pressing space scrolls you down the page.
Physics isn't an exact copy of the original game.
